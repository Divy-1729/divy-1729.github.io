                <h1 class="post-title">My favorite music to listen to</h1>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I spend a lot of time listening to music. Over the years I have curated a few go-to albums and artists that fit different parts of my day. Below are the kinds of music I reach for while studying, coding, grading, commuting, or working out. I have grouped the recommendations by activity to make it easy to pick something that suits the moment.</p>

                    <h2>Studying</h2>
                    <p>When I am at the University of Toronto deep in problem sets, instrumental soundtracks help me focus. The Oppenheimer soundtrack is a favorite. Tracks like "American Prometheus" stand out for their intensity and atmosphere. I also enjoy Hans Zimmer's work, especially the Dune soundtrack, which creates a wide, ethereal space that keeps me motivated while I race through assignments or wrestle with a tricky concept, like using integrating factors to solve differential equations.</p>

                    <h2>Coding</h2>
                    <p>Coding sessions, especially debugging PyTorch or wrestling with dependency issues, call for something calm and steady. I often put on mellow, psychedelic folk to stay centered. Favorites I return to are "Another One" by Mac DeMarco and "So Tonight I Might See" by Mazzy Star. These albums help me slow down, breathe, and get back into a focused mindset when the code is fighting back.</p>

                    <h2>Grading and Other Mundane Tasks</h2>
                    <p>When I am grading, I want to stay sharp and move efficiently. Fast-paced, attention-grabbing music helps me keep momentum. Arctic Monkeys' album AM is a reliable pick because its length often matches a single grading session. I also enjoy Fleetwood Mac, especially live recordings like "The Dance" for variety and energy.</p>

                    <h2>Commute</h2>
                    <p>I walk and take transit a lot, so music that sets the pace for my steps or eases a long ride is essential. On walks, Radiohead's "In Rainbows" is great for keeping a steady rhythm. For bus rides, I often play Alice in Chains' "Dirt" or other classic grunge like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. The rawness of grunge turns long or bumpy rides into something cathartic.</p>
                    <p>For downtown commutes on the GO train, I sometimes listen to the Succession soundtrack. The theme's beat gives a satisfying sense of arrival when I step off at Union Station. On long flights home, I return to Radiohead, especially earlier albums like "The Bends" and "OK Computer", and also enjoy Slowdive and Pink Floyd for their expansive soundscapes.</p>

                    <h2>Gym</h2>
                    <p>At the gym I prefer high-energy music. Bands and artists I often play include Rammstein, Deftones, Linkin Park, and Creed. These acts provide the drive I need for heavy sets and intense cardio.</p>

                    <h2>Parting Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>These picks represent what I reach for most days. I plan to write more posts exploring specific albums, playlists, and the stories behind why certain music works for different tasks. For now, I hope something on this list helps you find a soundtrack for your next study session, coding sprint, commute, or workout.</p>

                    <p>Until next time — take care.</p>
